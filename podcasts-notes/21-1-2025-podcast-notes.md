- Vibe coding" (or Vibe Engineering) is a 2025 AI-driven software development paradigm coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy, where developers shift from writing code line-by-line to guiding AI assistants (like Cursor, Bolt, or Replit) to generate, refine, and debug applications through conversational, natural language prompts. It emphasizes rapid prototyping and "moving fast" by treating AI as a pair programmer or agent that handles syntax and structure, allowing the developer to focus on the overall "vibe" or goal of the project.

# Notes:

- Advices on how to get out, reach out to people, and share your thoughts. Go out and experience things out there, make interactions like chemicals and produce things with people.
- How to use AI effeciently
- Debrief meetings with Claude with heads up next time, produce action items. Check-in notes. Diary.
- Organize your time by eliminate the uneccassery things like social media (time leaks), priotrize your day according to importance.
- The AI he uses in daily like (keywords above) to maintain his work in terms of coding and organizing.

For me: (Revisions and adjustments to)
- This fits in tasks system, or priority system
- this fits in time management system
- This fits in development systems (notion)
