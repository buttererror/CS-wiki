# Notes
- `Vue@2.x` vs `Vue@3.x` 
- [Vuex vs Pinia](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/advantages-of-pinia-vs-vuex/#who-created-pinia)
  > Vuex provides you with just one store which can have multiple modules within it. Whereas in Pinia, you can create multiple stores that can be imported into components directly where they’re needed. This allows bundlers to better code split and provides better TypeScript inferences.
  > Having multiple stores instead of just one also simplifies development, since only the methods of the Pinia Store (or module) need to be used each time, rather than the entire store in Vuex.
